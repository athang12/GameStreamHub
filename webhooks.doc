A webhook is a way for an application to provide other applications with real-time information. Webhooks deliver data to other applications as it happens, meaning you get data immediately. They are typically used to automate workflows and integrate different services.

How Webhooks Work:

Trigger Event: A specific event in the source application triggers the webhook.
HTTP Request: The source application sends an HTTP request to a predefined URL, typically via POST, containing the data related to the event.
Processing: The receiving application processes the data and performs any necessary actions.

Key Characteristics:

Real-time Communication: Unlike polling, where one application repeatedly requests data from another, webhooks push the data immediately as the event occurs.
HTTP Requests: They use HTTP requests, usually POST, to send data to a specific URL.
Event-Driven: They are event-driven, meaning they are triggered by specific events.

Uses and Benefits:

Real-Time Updates: Webhooks provide real-time data, ensuring that you always have the most up-to-date information without delay.
Automation: They can automate workflows by triggering actions in response to specific events (e.g., sending a notification when a new order is placed).
Efficiency: Reduce the need for continuous polling, which can save bandwidth and reduce latency.
Integration: Enable seamless integration between different services and applications. For example, integrating payment gateways, CRM systems, or issue trackers.
Customization: They allow you to build custom workflows tailored to specific business needs.
